# Traffic-Assistant-Application
The Traffic Assistant application (TAP) employs OCR technology to extract a car’s number plate or the ID number from one’s driving permit. These details are looked up in a proprietary database to determine the driver’s criminal record and whether their car has been involved in any criminal cases in the past.
